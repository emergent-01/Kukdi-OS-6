"""Kukdi's reasoning engine.

This is the ONLY module that knows an LLM exists. The rest of the product talks
to `reasoning` through two verbs:

    await reasoning.converse(history, user_text, context)  -> {reply, candidates, detected_state}
    await reasoning.answer(question, context)              -> str

`context` is a plain dict assembled by the routes (profile, active memories,
today's events). The engine never touches the database. To replace Claude with
another model — or a local one — reimplement this class; nothing else changes.
